# ChatGTP-Bot
This code defines a program that can take voice commands, interpret them using Google's speech recognition API, and generate a text-based response using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It then converts this text response into an audio file using Google's text-to-speech API and plays it using the Pygame library. The program continuously runs in a loop, waiting for voice commands containing the word "Alexa" to be spoken, and responds to those commands. It also includes error handling to handle cases where the speech recognition API cannot understand the spoken command. The program uses various Python libraries such as Pygame, OpenAI, SpeechRecognition, gradio, and gTTS to achieve these functionalities.
